# Lab 1

## Prelab Setup
After we uploaded the *ble_arduino.ino* into our Artemis, the MAC address of our Artemis was automatically printed it out because of the *Setup()* function.

When we updated our Artemis MAC address in the *connection.yml* file, we can connect our computer with the Artemis by bluetooth. We can send the commands from our computer in the Python file by using the bluetooth as the bridge to our board. The connection is shown:

## Lab Tasks
### Task 1
This task required to send an ECHO command with a string value from computer to board, and receive the augmented string. For the Artemis, I implemented a command case named *ECHO*. First, checked whether the string length exceeds the maximum length limit, and then appended the extra words to the string, and sent back finally.

On the computer, after the command code was loaded for the board, ran the ECHO command in the *demo.ipynb* and got the echo output:
