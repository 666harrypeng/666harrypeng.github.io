## Lab Tasks

### Task 1 - Set up the IMU

I used the QWIIC cable to connect the IMU and the Artemis board shown in the image as follows:

After I uploaded the example code, it did not work because the value of ***AD0_VAL*** is the default 1. However, the ADR jumper was closed, I changed its value from 1 to 0. In this way, the code worked. I shaked the IMU a little bit to get the changed acceleration and gyroscope data when rotating, flipping, and accelerating the board.

### Task 2 - Accelerometer

The accelerometer from our IMU returns the acceleration. In order to get the roll and pitch angles, we need to apply the following equations:

As I applied the equations in the code, I tested the outputs at {-90, 0, 90} degrees for pitch and roll.

* 0 degree pitch & 0 degree roll

* -90 degrees pitch

* 90 degrees pitch

* -90 degrees roll

* 90 degrees roll
