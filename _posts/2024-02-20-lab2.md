## Lab Tasks

### Task 1 - Set up the IMU

I used the QWIIC cable to connect the IMU and the Artemis board shown in the image as follows:

![imu_connection](/assets/images/lab2/imu_connection.JPG "imu_connection")

After I uploaded the example code, it did not work because the value of ***AD0_VAL*** is the default 1. However, the ADR jumper was closed, I changed its value from 1 to 0. In this way, the code worked. I shaked the IMU a little bit to get the changed acceleration and gyroscope data when rotating, flipping, and accelerating the board.

### Task 2 - Accelerometer

The accelerometer from our IMU returns the acceleration. In order to get the roll and pitch angles, we need to apply the following equations:

![pitch_roll_equations](/assets/images/lab2/pitch_roll_equations.png "pitch_roll_equations")

As I applied the equations in the code, I tested the outputs at {-90, 0, 90} degrees for pitch and roll.

* 0 degree pitch & 0 degree roll

![pitch0_roll0](/assets/images/lab2/pitch0_roll0.png "pitch0_roll0")

* -90 degrees pitch

![pitch-90](/assets/images/lab2/pitch-90.png "pitch-90")

* 90 degrees pitch

![pitch90](/assets/images/lab2/pitch90.png "pitch90")

* -90 degrees roll

![roll-90](/assets/images/lab2/roll-90.png "roll-90")

* 90 degrees roll

![roll90](/assets/images/lab2/roll90.png "roll90")

The accelerometer had a rather poor performance when I tested it at 0-pitch and 0-roll. The pitch values were noisy, but the roll values were far better. Other tested sitations all had good performance.

I recorded the pitch and roll values when I put the IMU on the table still for 15000 ms. I displayed the two kinds of data, which contained much noise.

![display_pitch_roll_data](/assets/images/lab2/display_pitch_roll_data.png "display_pitch_roll_data")

I applied FFT to the data and analysed the frequencies composition as follows:

![fft_image](/assets/images/lab2/fft_image.png "fft_image")

The FFT results showed that the pitch values focused on the base frequency data, but the roll values lied on the base to 10Hz frequency scope. To get more clearer data, a low pass filter with 10Hz cutoff frequency is perferred.

### Task 3 - Gyroscope
