# Lab 3

## Prelab

After I connected the sensor to the Artemis, uploaded the ***Example02_Wire_I2C.ino***, our board automatically returned the I2C sensor address as 0x29.

However, when I simultaneously used 2 ToF sensors, our board could not work well because the two sensors have the same I2C address which conflicts with each other. So, we needed to change one of the sensors' address. First , by using one of the GPIOs of Artemis (pin 8), we set the XShut pin of one Tof *sensor1* to LOW to disable *sensor1*. Then, we randomly assigned another I2C address to our still working *sensor2* and reset *sensor1*'s XShut to HIGH to let it function. So, in this way, both sensors will function simultaneously using different I2C addresses.

Based on this method of setting up the two sensors, we should wiring the components in this way:

We only have two ToF sensors to detect the distances. So, I will probably place one in the front of the robot and the other one on the side. However, this will obviously miss the obstacles behind the robot and the ones on the other side of the robot.
