## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to change from manual to open loop control of the car. The car should be able to execute a pre-programmed series of moves, using the Artemis board and two dual motor drivers.

## Prelab

The following diagram shows my intended connections between motor drivers, Artemis, and battery. Artemis pin assignments: pin ***4*** for ***BIN1 & AIN1***, pin ***A5*** for ***BIN2 & AIN2***, pin ***A15*** for ***BIN2 & AIN2***, pin ***A16*** for ***BIN1 & AIN1***. (pin ***4 & A5*** control one motor and ***A15 & A16*** control the other one.)

We have two batteries, and I decided to use one of them to power the Artemis board and the other one to power the motors. First reason is that separate power supply is better considering motors consume much more power. Second reason is that the current from motors would change drastically when doing some motions. The unstable current may damage the Artemis circuit, to lower down the transient noise effect.

## Lab Tasks

### Task1 - Setup with power supply and oscilloscope hookup
