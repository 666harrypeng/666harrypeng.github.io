## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to change from manual to open loop control of the car. The car should be able to execute a pre-programmed series of moves, using the Artemis board and two dual motor drivers.

## Prelab

The following diagram shows my intended connections between motor drivers, Artemis, and battery. Artemis pin assignments: pin ***4*** for ***BIN1 & AIN1***, pin ***A5*** for ***BIN2 & AIN2***, pin ***A15*** for ***BIN2 & AIN2***, pin ***A16*** for ***BIN1 & AIN1***. (pin ***4 & A5*** control one motor and ***A15 & A16*** control the other one.)

We have two batteries, and I decided to use one of them to power the Artemis board and the other one to power the motors. First reason is that separate power supply is better considering motors consume much more power. Second reason is that the current from motors would change drastically when doing some motions. The unstable current may damage the Artemis circuit, to lower down the transient noise effect.

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1 - Setup with power supply and oscilloscope hookup

To test the dual motor driver, I used a power supply to provide a controllable voltage limit at 3.7V (through Channel3), and the output of the driver was read using an oscilloscope:

### Task 2 - Power supply setting

The output voltage curve is shown as a square wave, which validates the motor driver. Also, from the oscilloscope, the peak-to-peak voltage is 4.64V which should be caused by the noise from the motor driver. To simulate the real battery charging the robot, the voltage from the power supply was set to the same voltage output as the 850mAh battery â€“ 3.7V.

### Task 3 - AnalogWrite code to tests the motor drivers

I used a sketch file to test the motor drivers by setting the output pins and the PWM values.

### Task 6 - Both wheels spinning with battery driving the motor drivers

I assembled the sensors, Artemis and batteries and test the two wheels spinning with the following code:
