## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to implement linear position PID control and pick whatever controller works best for the robot system. Use the control system to let the robot drive as fast as possible towards a wall, then stop when it is exactly 1ft (=304mm=1 floor tile in the lab) away from the wall using feedback from the ToF sensor.

## Prelab - Optimization of BLE Data Transfer Module

The general idea is similar to lab1 â€“ Use BLE to transmit data between Artemis and our own PC. I implemented this module by first collecting all the related debug data readings (e.g. time, distance readings from ToF, PWM duty cycle value of the left and right motors...), and then use a function/case to continuously transmit all the data in one go. On my PC, I receiving the data by first connecting the Artemis board BLE through the MAC address, and then parsing the transmitted strings by the optimized notification handler.

In my Artemis board code, I implemented the case ***SEND_DEBUG_READINGS*** which is used to send the data to the PC. All the array variables were pre-defined as the global variables.

On my PC, the corresponding handler was modified as:

![handler_code](/assets/images/lab5/handler_code.png "handler_code")

In this way, I can directly access all the wanted debug readings which would be stored in those arrays (e.g. generating the plots of Distance error vs Time).

## Lab Tasks

### Task1 - ToF Sampling Time Discussion

In this lab, considering the requirements that the robot car should start 2 ~ 4 meters away from the wall and the ToF's sensing range, I generally chose the **long** distance mode because the range of short distance mode is [0, 1.3m] with the extreme limit 2m, and the range of long distance is [0, 4m] with extreme limit 4.3m. After I tested the sampling rate of the ToF, I found that the difference bewteen the rate of PID control information updates and the rate of ToF sampling quite big. (The standard sampling rate of ToF is about 50Hz, but in practice is quite slow when there are other constraints, such as the completion of soldering and the code latency)

Based on this performance, it is necessary to implement filters or extrapolation to make the ToF readings "updated" more frequently.

### Task2 - Range of P-Controller Gain

Here, we can only implement the PID control in discrete time. For the P-controller, the gain can be calculated as $P = K_p \times \text{Error}$. The range of the PWM value for the function ***analogWrite()*** is [0, 255]. Also, during past labs, the motors' deadband is approximately 65, and the ***Error*** can be a thousand. So, based on - $K_p \times \text{Error} + 65 \in [65, 255]$, we can accrodingly get the rough range of the P-gain: 0~0.5.
