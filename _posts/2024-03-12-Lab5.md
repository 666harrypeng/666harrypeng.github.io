## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to implement linear position PID control and pick whatever controller works best for the robot system.

## Prelab - Optimization of BLE Data Transfer Module

The general idea is similar to lab1 â€“ Use BLE to transmit data between Artemis and our own PC. I implemented this module by first collecting all the related debug data readings (e.g. time, distance readings from ToF, PWM duty cycle value of the left and right motors...), and then use a function/case to continuously transmit all the data in one go. On my PC, I receiving the data by first connecting the Artemis board BLE through the MAC address, and then parsing the transmitted strings by the optimized notification handler.

In my Artemis board code, I implemented the case ***SEND_DEBUG_READINGS*** which is used to send the data to the PC. All the array variables were pre-defined as the global variables. 

![debug_reading_case_code](/assets/images/lab5/debug_reading_case_code.png "debug_reading_case_code")

On my PC, the corresponding handler was modified as:

![handler_code](/assets/images/lab5/handler_code.png "handler_code")

In this way, I can directly access all the wanted debug readings which would be stored in those arrays (e.g. generating the plots of Distance error vs Time).
