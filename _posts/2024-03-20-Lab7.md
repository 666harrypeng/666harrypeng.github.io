## Objective

The objective of Lab 7 is to implement a Kalman Filter, which will help to execute the PID-related behaviors in Lab 5 faster. The goal now is to use the Kalman Filter to supplement the slowly sampled ToF values, such that you can speed towards the wall as fast as possible, then either stop 1ft from the wall or turn within 2ft.

## Keyword

Kalman Filter

## Mathmatical Theory Foundation

The ***Kalman filter*** provides a systematic way to incorporate uncertainty to get better estimates of the state of a dynamic system in real-time, based on both inputs and observations. Here, we assume posterior and prior belief are in Gaussian distribution.

For a system with closed-loop control, the block diagram can be shown as:

![kf_block_diagram](/assets/images/lab7/kf_block_diagram.png "kf_block_diagram")

And for PID control system, the block diagram can be shown as:

![kf_block_diagram_pid](/assets/images/lab7/kf_block_diagram_pid.png "kf_block_diagram_pid")

For a certain system, if we can have the state-space equations as:

$$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$$

$$y = Cx$$

The prediction and the update steps for Kalman Filter are:

where we have the notations as:

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1 - Drag and Momentum Estimation

To build a state space model for the system, we need to estimate the drag and momentum for A and B matrices, if we build a model based on:

![ss_equations](/assets/images/lab7/ss_equations.png "ss_equations")

Here, I let the car drive to the wall at a constant input motor speed and simultaneously record the sensors readings. To keep the dynamics similar to the PWM values used in Lab5 & 6 for PID control, I chose the maximum step response $u(t)$ as around 80 for the PWM duty cycle, and regard the 90% of the $u(t)$ as the steady state "velocity".

I tested the car for many times and got the data and corresponding plots. Here, I selected two of them.

I implemented a new case in Artemis for Kalman filter - ***KALMAN_FILTER_TEST***:

![KALMAN_FILTER_TEST_code](/assets/images/lab7/KALMAN_FILTER_TEST_code.png "KALMAN_FILTER_TEST_code")

On the PC side, I used the same notification handler as the one used for PID Moving Forward Control, to receive the sensors' readings transmitted by BLE.

For the first run, the step response of PWM real-time duty cycles was:

![pwm](/assets/images/lab7/pwm.png "pwm")

The distance readings from ToF were:

![distance_time](/assets/images/lab7/distance_time.png "distance_time")

I calculated the "real-time" velocity by averaging the adjacent three points' distance readings and the time gap:
$$v^{(i)} = \frac{\text{Distance}^{(i-1)} - \text{Distance}^{(i+1)}}{\text{Time}^{(i-1)} - \text{Time}^{(i+1)}}$$

Based on this, I got the velocity vs time plot:

![velocity_time](/assets/images/lab7/velocity_time.png "velocity_time")

And meanwhile, got the rise time and the steady-state velocity which are shown in the image.

Similarly, for the second run, the PWM values:

![pwm_2](/assets/images/lab7/pwm_2.png "pwm_2")

The distance readings from ToF:

![distance_time_2](/assets/images/lab7/distance_time_2.png "distance_time_2")

The velocity:

![velocity_time_2](/assets/images/lab7/velocity_time_2.png "velocity_time_2")

To calculate drag, we look at the steady state speed:

![derive_d](/assets/images/lab7/derive_d.png "derive_d")

As for momentum, use the rise time to calculate:

![derive_m](/assets/images/lab7/derive_m.png "derive_m")

Based on these two groups of data, I calculated the drag and momentum as follows:

Drag and Momentum from group1:

![d_m](/assets/images/lab7/d_m.png "d_m")

From group2:

![d_m_2](/assets/images/lab7/d_m_2.png "d_m_2")

The average of them:

![average_d_m](/assets/images/lab7/average_d_m.png "average_d_m")

### Task 2 - Kalman Filter Initialization on Python

For the process noise $\Sigma_u$ and measurement noise $\Sigma_z$, based on our assumption that they are in Gaussian distribution, we can get:

![noise_covariance](/assets/images/lab7/noise_covariance.png "noise_covariance")

As for the measurement noise, from past labs, the ToF can have around 20mm error. So, I first set $\sigma_3$ as 0.02. As for the process noise, $\sigma_1$ is the uncertainty for the position of the robot which should be similar to the sensor's readings. So, I first set $\sigma_1$ as 0.02, too. As for the $\sigma_2$, this is the uncertainty for the velocity of the robot, I first initialized it as 0.1 which should be finetuned later.

So, we can initialize them as:

![sigma_ini](/assets/images/lab7/sigma_ini.png "sigma_ini")

(***Note***: Basically, $\sigma$ denotes the trust for the measurement data or the trust for the model. When the value of $\sigma$ becomes larger, the trust gets more.)

Now, I can get A and B based on the Drag and Momentum. We should discretize A and B to get Ad and Bd considering we are dealing with discrete-time signals:

![AB_discrete](/assets/images/lab7/AB_discrete.png "AB_discrete")

In Python code, I implemented them as:

![ABC_Ad_Bd_code](/assets/images/lab7/ABC_Ad_Bd_code.png "ABC_Ad_Bd_code")

where ***n*** is the dimension for the state space. So, C can be written as [-1, 0] (because we measure the negative distance from the wall).

Last, we should initialize the state vector ***x*** as x = np.array([[-distanceData[0]], [0]])

### Task 3 - Kalman Filter Simulation Test on Python

First, prepare the data. I loaded the saved data from PID control test:

![load_data](/assets/images/lab7/load_data.png "load_data")

where I also finished scaling the PWM values.

Then, according to the Kalman filter's algorithm, I implemented the function for KF:

![kf_func_code](/assets/images/lab7/kf_func_code.png "kf_func_code")

Next, loop every data point using the filter:

![kf_application](/assets/images/lab7/kf_application.png "kf_application")

I plotted the curve from measurement and the curve with Kalman filter as follows:

![kf_tof_plot](/assets/images/lab7/kf_tof_plot.png "kf_tof_plot")

which indicated that the performance of the kalman filter was great.

To test the influences of the covariance matrices to the performance of the filter, I adjusted the trust - I let the final data trust more on measurement, and adjusted the $\sigma_3$ from 0.02 to 2.

I got the curves comparison as follows:

![trust_more_measurement](/assets/images/lab7/trust_more_measurement.png "trust_more_measurement")

where the difference is reasonable because when we choose to trust more on measurement, due to the low sampling rate of ToF, the Kalman Filter could only get the prediction mostly based on the measurement. So, it can generate much difference.
