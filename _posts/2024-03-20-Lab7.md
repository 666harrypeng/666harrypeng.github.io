## Objective

The objective of Lab 7 is to implement a Kalman Filter, which will help to execute the PID-related behaviors in Lab 5 faster. The goal now is to use the Kalman Filter to supplement the slowly sampled ToF values, such that you can speed towards the wall as fast as possible, then either stop 1ft from the wall or turn within 2ft.

## Keyword

Kalman Filter

## Mathmatical Theory Foundation

The ***Kalman filter*** provides a systematic way to incorporate uncertainty to get better estimates of the state of a dynamic system in real-time, based on both inputs and observations. Here, we assume posterior and prior belief are in Gaussian distribution.

For a system with closed-loop control, the block diagram can be shown as:

And for PID control system, the block diagram can be shown as:

![kf_block_diagram_pid](/assets/images/lab7/kf_block_diagram_pid.png "kf_block_diagram_pid")

For a certain system, if we can have the state-space equations as:

$$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$$

$$y = Cx$$

The prediction and the update steps for Kalman Filter are:

where we have the notations as:

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1 - Drag and Momentum Estimation

To build a state space model for the system, we need to estimate the drag and momentum for A and B matrices, if we build a model based on:
